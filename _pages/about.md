Hi! I am a 4B Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

Currently, I am interning at NVIDIA as a Software Engineer on the GPU Kernel team. Previously, I interned at Google (LLM Fine-Tuning), TuSimple (Perception for Autonomous Trucks), and Huawei Canada (Low-Latency C++).

I've had the previledge of working with Prof. Wenhu Chen, Pref. Yaoliang Yu, Prof. Alexander Wong, Prof. Jimmy Lin, and Prof. Yash Pant at the University of Waterloo.
I am broadly interested in novel Machine Learning methods that solve real-world problems in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Recently I have been exploring Deep Generative Models.

I've been a huge sports fan my entire life. Soccer, Football, Basketball, Hockey, swimming, tennis, pingpong are some of my favorites.

In my free time, I enjoy playing Go (mostly online). I also use AI to help me improve my game and it has led to me interest in AI.
