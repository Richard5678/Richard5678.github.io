Hi! I am a 4B Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

Currently, I am interning at NVIDIA as a Software Engineer on the GPU Kernel team. Previously, I interned at

- Google (LLM Fine-Tuning & Knowledge Distillation)
- TuSimple (Perception for Autonomous Trucks)
- Huawei Canada (Low-Latency C++)

I've had the previledge of working with

- Prof. Wenhu Chen (LLM Benchmarking & Video Generation)
- Pref. Yaoliang Yu (Data Poisoning & Privacy Protection)
- Prof. Alexander Wong (Copyright Infringement Detection)
- Prof. Jimmy Lin (Embedding Extraction)
- Prof. Yash Pant (F1tenth Autonomous Racing)

My research interest lies in

- Controllable Deep Generative Models (text to image/video) while preserving creativity
- Alignment algorithms for Large Multi-Modal Models

I've been a huge sports fan my entire life. Soccer, Football, Basketball, Hockey, swimming, tennis, pingpong are some of my favorites.

Fun fact: I am a 5 Dan Go player (started playing since primary school). AlphaGo sparked my passion to understand intelligence.
